# Face Landmark Detection Using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** and **OpenCV** to detect and display facial landmarks in real time using the webcam.  
It can detect **multiple faces (up to 10)** and plot all 468 landmark points on each face.


# Features
- Real-time face landmark detection  
- Supports up to **10 faces** simultaneously  
- Uses lightweight and fast **MediaPipe FaceMesh**  
- Works on any system with a webcam  
- Simple and clean OpenCV visualization
